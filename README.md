### **About Me**

I am a Computer Science graduate (B.Sc.) with a strong theoretical foundation and proven experience in academic research.  
My final project involved developing a predictive model for medical readmission, a study that led to **Israel’s first academic publication of its kind**.

While my academic work focused on Python and Machine Learning, my current professional mission is to master **modern C++ for high-performance computing** and backend software engineering.
