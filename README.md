### **About Me**

I am a Computer Science graduate (B.Sc.) with a strong theoretical foundation and proven experience in academic research. My final project involved developing a predictive model for medical readmission, a study that led to **Israel’s first academic publication of its kind**.

I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems through logic and code. While my academic work was focused on Python and Machine Learning, my current professional mission is to master **modern C++ for high-performance computing.**
