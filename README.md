### About Me
I am a Computer Science student with academic experience in **algorithms**, **computer architecture**, and **networking**.  
My academic journey included developing a predictive model for medical readmission, leading to *Israel's first publication of its kind*.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in **Modern C++** for high-performance computing, combining my analytical background with practical training to build efficient and scalable software solutions.
