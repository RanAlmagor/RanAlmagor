### **About Me**

I am a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in software engineering and data science.  
Currently, I am completing my capstone research project on **medical readmission prediction** â€” one of the first studies of its kind in Israel combining machine learning, data analysis, and academic writing.  

I enjoy tackling complex problems, learning new technologies, and building practical projects to apply my skills.
