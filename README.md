### *About Me*

I am a Computer Science graduate (B.Sc.) with a strong theoretical foundation in algorithms and computer architecture. My academic journey culminated in a research project developing a predictive model for medical readmission, which led to *Israel's first publication of its kind*.

I am driven by the challenge of taking on difficult problems. My current mission is to apply my analytical background to master *modern C++ for high-performance computing.*
