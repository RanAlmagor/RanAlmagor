### **About Me**

I am a Computer Science graduate (B.Sc.) with a strong theoretical foundation and proven experience in academic research. My final project involved developing a predictive model for medical readmission, a study that led to **Israelâ€™s first academic publication of its kind**.

I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems through logic and code. While my academic work was focused on Python and Machine Learning, my current professional mission is to master **modern C++ for high-performance computing.**


### **Current Mission**

My current focus is entirely on the intensive, hands-on study of C++. I am building my expertise from the ground up to become a specialist in creating robust and efficient systems.

* **ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building:** My first foundational C++ projects.
* **ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:** C++ fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming, and Memory Management.
