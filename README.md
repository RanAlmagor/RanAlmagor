## 🧩 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student from Israel, currently moving my focus towards **Modern C++**  
and real-time / simulation projects.

I also worked as a research assistant on a **hospital readmission prediction** project  
(Python, data analysis, ML) together with a medical center and academic staff.

## 🚀 Highlighted Projects

- 🎆 **The Ultimate Polymorphic Fireworks Show**  
  High-performance fireworks simulation in Modern C++ and SFML 3.  
  Focus on OOP, polymorphism, RAII and clean architecture.

- 🧪 **Physics Sandbox – 2D Particle Simulation**  
  Falling-sand style sandbox written in Modern C++ and SFML.  
  Grid-based particles (sand, water, stone) with simple real-time physics.

- 🧱 **Cpp-Core-Concepts**  
  A collection of small projects and exercises in Modern C++:  
  custom string class, polymorphic banking system, memory management, etc.

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

- **Languages:** Modern C++ (C++17/20), Python (pandas, scikit-learn)  
- **Libraries / Engines:** SFML 3, starting to explore OpenGL & Unreal Engine 5  
- **Topics I care about:** RAII, smart pointers, OOP, clean code, real-time behavior  

---

## 🎯 What I'm Working On Now

- Expanding my **Modern C++** skills through real projects  
- Improving my simulations / game-like systems with SFML  
- Gradually learning **OpenGL** and **Unreal Engine 5**  
- Building a portfolio that shows I can think like an engineer, not רק לפתור תרגילים 😉

## 🌱 Beyond Code

I’m also into **Spanish**, self-development, and staying in shape –  
trying to grow as a person alongside becoming a stronger engineer.
