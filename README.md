### 🚀 Projects (Learning Stage)

- 🎆 **Polymorphic Fireworks (WIP)**  
  Small fireworks prototype in Modern C++ – practice for OOP, inheritance and RAII.  
  Uses SFML as a simple rendering layer while I'm still learning the library.

- 🧪 **Physics Sandbox (WIP)**  
  Early 2D particle / falling-sand sandbox in Modern C++.  
  A playground for getting comfortable with a game-loop style and basic SFML usage.

- 🧱 **Cpp-Core-Concepts**  
  Collection of small Modern C++ exercises: custom string class, polymorphic banking
  system, memory & pointer practice as I go through C++ courses.

### 🛠 Currently Learning

`Modern C++17/20` · `SFML (beginner level)` · `OpenGL (intro)` · `Unreal Engine 5 (intro)`

### 🌱 On the side

Experimenting with **Stable Diffusion** for Tron-style banners and visuals,  
and slowly turning these experiments into more serious C++ / graphics projects.
