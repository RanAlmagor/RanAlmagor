### 🚀 Projects & Experiments

- 🎆 **Polymorphic Fireworks**  
  Small fireworks prototype in Modern C++ – practice for OOP, inheritance and RAII.  
  Uses SFML as a simple rendering layer while I'm still learning the library.

- 🪣 **Physics Sandbox**  
  2D falling-sand / particle sandbox in Modern C++.  
  A playground for getting comfortable with a game loop and basic SFML usage.

- 🧱 **Cpp-Core-Concepts**  
  Collection of small Modern C++ exercises: custom string class, polymorphic banking
  system, memory & pointer practice as I go through C++ courses.
